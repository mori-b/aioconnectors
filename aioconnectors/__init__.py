https://github.com/mori-b/aioconnectors

aioconnectors is an easy to set up broker that currently works on Unix like systems.
Requirements are : Python >= 3.6, and openssl installed.
It makes it easy to securely send and receive loads of messages and files between remote applications.
- Easy and fast installation with pip, zero dependency
- Nice trade off between ease of use and efficiency
- Supports several use cases : transfer of messages, files, authentication, encryption, persistence, point-to-point, publish/subscribe. All configurable by simply modifying a configuration file
- User friendly and intuitive API, with simple Python asynchronous functions to send and receive messages, easy to integrate in an existing asyncio code base
- Bidirectional : client and server can push messages to each other
- Embeds a command line interface, which can manage the broker through the command line
- Embeds an encrypted chat/file transfer tool easily callable through the command line

The command line tool can be called by "python3 -m aioconnectors --help"
Usage examples can be found in applications.py
